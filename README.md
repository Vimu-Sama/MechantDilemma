# MerchantDilemma
 This game follows the theme of GameJam oriented task, where I had to make this particular game based on theme- "Limited Capacity" and submit it within 4 days. This assignment was given by OutScal.
The game follows the following story- A merchant has to deliver packages but, he can carry only limited number of packages at a time, thus, he has to carry and grab the packages again and again, a 2-D death stranding kinda project in making.
Thank You!
